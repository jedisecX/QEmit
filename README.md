# QEmit-Powered 1969 Mustang

## Overview
The QEmit-powered 1969 Mustang is a futuristic re-engineering of the classic Ford Mustang, replacing traditional propulsion with a **magnetic-core, superconducting gallium-mercury loop, ion lifters, and ion thrusters** for hovering and propulsion. This project explores the **feasibility, energy efficiency, and real-world application** of QEmit technology in vehicular travel.

## Objectives
- **Remove traditional wheels** and replace them with **ion lifters** for lift.
- **Integrate superconducting energy transfer** via a **gallium-mercury loop**.
- **Install ion thrusters** for controlled propulsion and maneuverability.
- **Develop an advanced control system** for RPM regulation, stability, and power distribution.
- **Implement a digital dashboard interface** displaying real-time performance data.

## Technical Breakdown
### 1. **Frame & Chassis Modifications**
   - Reinforced structure to support ion lifters and superconducting loop.
   - Protective shielding for magnetic interference.

### 2. **Propulsion & Energy Systems**
   - **Magnetic Core:** Generates rotational energy for power distribution.
   - **Superconducting Loop:** Gallium-mercury-based closed circuit for efficient energy transfer.
   - **Ion Lifters:** Electrostatic lift system replacing wheels.
   - **Ion Thrusters:** High-voltage acceleration for directional thrust.

### 3. **Control & Stability Systems**
   - **PWM Controllers** for RPM and field adjustments.
   - **PID Feedback Loop** for real-time stabilization.
   - **Hall Effect Sensors** for magnetic field monitoring.

### 4. **Digital Interface**
