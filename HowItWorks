1Ô∏è‚É£ Core Magnetic System & Energy Circulation

Generating Rotational Energy:

At the heart of QEmit is a magnetic core‚Äîeither a Neodymium N52 permanent magnet or a superconducting electromagnet.

When activated, an electrical current (I) flows through the coil surrounding the core, generating a rotating magnetic field (B).

This field interacts with the superconducting gallium-mercury loop, which acts as a high-efficiency energy transfer medium.


Superconducting Loop for Energy Efficiency:

The gallium-mercury superconducting loop allows electrons to flow with near-zero resistance, keeping energy circulating efficiently.

This loop is enclosed in a liquid nitrogen cooling system, which keeps it at the necessary superconducting temperature.

Because of superconductivity, once the system is started, it can sustain energy flow with minimal external input.


üîπ Why This Matters:
‚úÖ Maintains continuous energy circulation with minimal power loss.
‚úÖ Supports ion propulsion systems by supplying high-voltage energy.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Lift Generation via Ion Lifters

How Electrostatic Lift Works:

Ion lifters use high-voltage electrodes to ionize air molecules, creating an electrostatic lift force (Biefeld-Brown Effect).

The system applies a high-voltage charge to an upper electrode, which attracts negative ions.

These ions are accelerated downward, creating an upward force that lifts the vehicle.


Control & Efficiency:

A microcontroller dynamically adjusts the lift force by controlling voltage and charge distribution.

A PID feedback loop ensures stable hovering and altitude adjustments.


üîπ Why This Matters:
‚úÖ Provides silent and efficient lift without mechanical moving parts.
‚úÖ Uses electrostatic forces instead of traditional combustion thrust.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Ion Thrusters for Propulsion & Maneuverability

How Ion Thrusters Generate Thrust:

Ion thrusters work by accelerating charged particles (ions) through an electric field.

An electrostatic grid creates a potential difference, causing ions to be expelled at high velocity.

This expulsion of ions generates controlled thrust, allowing the system to move forward.


Adaptive Thrust Control:

The amount of thrust is controlled by varying the voltage applied to the acceleration grid.

Directional adjustments are achieved by modulating thruster output on different sides of the vehicle.


üîπ Why This Matters:
‚úÖ Allows precise movement & speed control without traditional fuel-based propulsion.
‚úÖ Silent operation, unlike combustion engines or jet propulsion.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Real-Time RPM & Power Regulation

Controlling Magnetic Core Speed & Energy Flow

A Hall Effect sensor continuously measures the rotational speed (RPM) of the magnetic core.

A PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) circuit adjusts the input voltage to regulate magnetic field strength.

A PID controller automatically fine-tunes energy flow to prevent instability or overspinning.


Adaptive Power Management:

Back-EMF feedback regulation ensures that excess energy is fed back into the system instead of being wasted.

A battery or capacitor system stores surplus energy to prevent overload conditions.


üîπ Why This Matters:
‚úÖ Self-regulating system minimizes energy loss and extends operational lifespan.
‚úÖ Maintains optimal RPM & field strength for propulsion stability.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Cryogenic Cooling for Superconductivity

Maintaining Superconducting Efficiency:

The superconducting gallium-mercury loop must remain at extremely low temperatures to function efficiently.

A closed-loop liquid nitrogen (LN‚ÇÇ) cooling system circulates around the superconducting materials.

Magnetocaloric cooling materials assist in stabilizing the system without excessive energy input.


üîπ Why This Matters:
‚úÖ Ensures energy efficiency by maintaining superconductivity.
‚úÖ Reduces system heat buildup, preventing loss of performance.
